XBT Drive Setup
 You must create an XBT Drive before you can use XBT.
 You can use any USB storage device for your XBT Drive. It should have enough
 storage capacity to hold all of the data in the /home directories of all the
 machines you'd like to make backups from. This tool works with USB storage 
 devices with under 2 TB of total data capacity. Lager drives will have to be 
 formatted manually. XBT Drive Setup will format and label a drive for use with 
 XBT. The partition will be labeled "XBT_Drive" so the program can find it.
 The drive MUST be formatted with a native Linux file system such as Ext4
 or XFS for the backups to retain the correct permissions. You must run XBT
 Backup to set the correct ownership permissions for you new XBT Drive. 
  *************************************************************************
  * WARNING: XBT Drive Setup will clear ALL DATA on the USB drive chosen! *
  *************************************************************************
 Double check you have the drive you want to use plugged in before continuing!

 XBT -- External Backup Tool -- Help
 (v. 3.0)
 Press "q" to exit this Help page and return to Main Menu.
 Commands:
 xbt = Starts XBT program with menu options.
 xbt --backup = Fully backs up host's /etc and /home directories to XBT_Drive.
 xbt --restore = Fully restores host machine's /home directory from XBT_Drive.
 xbt --help = Prints this help information.
 xbt --log = Prints log from XBT drive in interactive viewer. ("q" to exit.)
 Description:
 XBT is a program that makes keeping all of your user data safely backed up on
 a dedicated External USB drive easy.
 XBT will update files that have changed, remove files that have been
 deleted and add any new files that have been created since the last backup.
 The initial backup can take a lot of time if you have a lot of data stored
 in your system's /home directory. XBT creates a directory with the host name
 of the machine it's backing up from inside XBT-Backups. This allows users to
 share one XBT_Drive with multiple machines.
 The directory structure and all files are stored openly to allow users easy
 access if they only need to retrieve a few files or directories using a file
 manager. Data from /home can be restored with the built in "xbt restore"
 command if the user wants to roll back to the exact state of /home when the
 last backup was taken.
 A simple log file is added to the XBT_Drive that shows when each new
 backup is taken and any errors that might occur. This file is appended
 every time XBT is run. The log file is placed in XBT-Backups. You can view the
 last several backups by using the XBT Log viewer. Press "q" to exit when
 you're done.
 Requirements:
 XBT is designed to work with Ubuntu and Linux Mint but it should run
 on many other Linux distributions. You need to prepare an XBT Drive.
 This can be any USB storage device. The dedicated USB drive must be
 formatted to a Linux native file system such as Ext4 to ensure that file
 permissions will be stored unchanged. The USB drive needs to have enough
 free capacity to store all data in /home on all of the machines you want to
 use the drive for. The drive MUST be labeled as "XBT_Drive" for the script
 to run. If XBT_Drive is not detected, the script exits with an error.
 XBT Drive Setup allows you to choose a drive to designate as the XBT Drive. The
 selected drive will be "blanked," formatted with ext4 and labeled 'XBT_Drive."
 This option is available in the Main Menu.
 Feedback:
 Feel free to contact EzeeLinux with comments and suggestions for XBT and
 future projects.
